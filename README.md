[Documentation](https://docs.rs/ssh2)

Rust bindings to libssh2, an ssh client library.

## Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
ssh2 = "0.5"
```

## Building on OSX 10.10+

This library depends on OpenSSL. To get OpenSSL working follow the
[`openssl` crate's instructions](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl#macos).

Starting with version `0.4` of `ssh2`, you can enable the `vendored-openssl` feature
to have `libssh2` built against a statically built version of openssl as [described
here](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.24/openssl/#vendored)
